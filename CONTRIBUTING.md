## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Begin by forking this repository and cloning your fork locally.

2. **Create a Branch**  
   Use a descriptive branch name to explain the feature or fix you are working on, e.g., `feature/new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue`.

3. **Stay Up-to-Date**  
   Regularly pull changes from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.

## Coding Conventions

To maintain consistency across the codebase, we adhere to **Qt's QML Coding Conventions** and **Qt Quick Best Practices**. Please review and follow the guidelines outlined in the official documentation:

- [QML Coding Conventions](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qml-codingconventions.html)
- [Qt Quick Best Practices](https://doc-snapshots.qt.io/qt6-dev/qtquick-bestpractices.html)

Key points to remember:
- Use descriptive, camelCase names for variables and functions.
- Ensure proper indentation.
- Avoid unnecessary bindings; keep expressions simple.
- Use `parent` sparingly and thoughtfully.
- Make sure to declare types in JS instead of using `var`.

## Development Environment

This project targets the **newest version of Qt** available. All contributors should:
- Use the latest stable or development version of Qt.
- Test code on the newest features and APIs introduced in the latest Qt release.
- Avoid deprecated or obsolete functions.

If a feature requires the use of a specific Qt version, clearly document this in your pull request.

## Submitting Contributions

1. **Open an Issue**  
   Before starting major changes, create an issue to discuss your plans. Ensure your contribution aligns with the project's roadmap.

2. **Make Atomic Commits**  
   Write meaningful commit messages and keep changes focused. Each commit should ideally represent a single task or improvement.

3. **Follow the Pull Request Template**  
   When submitting a pull request:
   - Reference the issue number (if applicable).
   - Explain the changes you made and why they are necessary.
   - Include any relevant screenshots or logs.
